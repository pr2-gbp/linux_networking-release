dynreconf_test
--------------

Description: 
  * tests the traffic control functionality using the dynamic_reconfigure interface

Tests:
  * test_latency: tests that latency (delay) works, both on egress and ingress
  * test_bandwidth: tests that bandwidth limits work, both on egress and ingres
  * test_bandwidth_latency: tests that a simultaneous bandwidth limit on egress and 
latency emulation on ingress work as expected
  * test_ingress_egress_loss: tests that simultaneous loss emulation on ingress and
egress works as expected
  * test_packet_size: tests that the packet_size parameters works as intended
  * test_bandwidth_latency_loss: performs many tests of all three parameters together, 
using the values projected by projected_link_metrics.py as reference
