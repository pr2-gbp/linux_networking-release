Old TODOs:
- iwevent monitoring, and use of iwconfig to determine if an interface is
  wireless, and what bssid it is connected to. Publish events based on
  these.

- auto ifconfig up/down

- state machine for scanning and selecting a bssid

- module to set IP address after dhcp

- at shutdown, make sure the IP address gets deconfigured.


Release checklist:
- condense configuration for PR2
  - read interface config from /etc/interfaces ?
  - read VPN endpoint from openvpn config?
- streamline install process
- status interface
  - keep robot_status page in mind
  - keep in mind adding state wired/wireless to login banner
- support interfaces with a static IP configuration
- bring back beep on cable plug/unplug
- manage /etc/resolv.conf

Other considerations:
- consider equipping a PR2 with a 3G modem
