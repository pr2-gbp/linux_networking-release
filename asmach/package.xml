  <description>SMACH, which stands for 'state machine', is a task-level
    architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behavior. At its
    core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build
    hierarchical state machines.  SMACH is a new library that takes
    advantage of very old concepts in order to quickly create robust
    robot behavior with maintainable and modular code.</description>
