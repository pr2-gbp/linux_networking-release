Description: SMACH, which stands for 'state machine', is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behavior.
 At its core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build hierarchical state machines. SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular code.
